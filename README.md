# **Unsilencing Colonial Archives — Transformer Edition**  
_Replicating and extending the ideas from “Unsilencing Colonial Archives via Automated Entity Recognition”  with a custom Transformer architecture._

## Overview
This repository showcases an experimental replication of the approach presented in [*Unsilencing Colonial Archives via Automated Entity Recognition*] , using a **self-programmed Transformer** to detect various entities (including named and unnamed persons) in historical VOC (Dutch East India Company) testament texts.

The original paper proposes a tailor-made annotation typology to tackle challenging archival data, spotlighting how automation can **broaden access** to marginalized voices often left out of conventional archival indexes. Here, instead of relying on off-the-shelf models, we’re **rolling our own** Transformer.
